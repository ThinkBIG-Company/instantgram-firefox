[Versão em Português =)](http://thinkbig-company.github.io/instantgram-light/lang/pt-br)

[instantgram-light] is a bookmarklet with the purpose of downloading Instagram images. It is tiny, simple, and doesn't require extensions or downloads. Just access [this link][1] and drag the [instantgram] button to the bookmark bar of your browser, navigate to instagram.com (web), open an Instagram post (photo) and click on the bookmarklet. That's all it takes!
